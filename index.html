            One particular book which is recommended reading is The Street <mark style="background-color: red;">Lawyer</mark> by John Grisham. This book is about
            a lawyer who begins re-evaluating his priorities in life when a bad incident occurs within his law firm.
            Consequently,he becomes acquainted with the innercity streets, and realizes the harsh existence of the homeless,
            and vows to give them a chance in the courts.<i>TheStreet Lawyer</i> is a <i><b>great</b></i> book. It is well 
            <i><b>written</b></i> and <i><b>interesting</b></i>. Other books byJohn Grisham include The Firm, The Pelican Brief and The Client.
